            "1. Choose a quiet and distraction-free area: Find a quiet area with minimal distractions where your dog can focus on you.\n",

            "* Use a consistent command: Choose a consistent command for \"sit\" and use it every time you want your dog to sit.\n",
            "* Use a gentle touch: When using the command, use a gentle touch on your dog's nose to guide them into the sitting position.\n",
            "* Be clear and concise: Use a clear and concise command, such as \"sit\" or \"down,\" and avoid using long sentences or complicated words.\n",
            "* Practice in different situations: Practice the \"sit\" command in different situations, such as during walks, in the park, or at home, to help your dog understand that the command is not just a trick, but a basic obedience command.\n",

I\\'ve done this several times going from larger HDD to smaller SSD and I wound up with a bootable SSD drive. One step you have to remember not to skip is to use Disk Utility to partition the SSD as GUID partition scheme HFS+ before doing the clone. If it came Apple Partition Scheme, even if you let CCC do the clone, the resulting drive won\\'t be bootable. CCC usually works in \"file mode\" and it can easily copy a larger drive (that\\'s mostly empty) onto a smaller drive. If you tell CCC to clone a drive you did NOT boot from, it can work in block copy mode where the destination drive must be the same size or larger than the drive you are cloning from (if I recall).\\nI\\'ve actually done this somehow on Disk Utility several times (booting from a different drive (or even the dvd) so not running disk utility from the drive your cloning) and had it work just fine from larger to smaller bootable clone. Definitely format the drive cloning to first, as bootable Apple etc..\\nThanks for pointing this out. My only experience using DU to go larger to smaller was when I was trying to make a Lion install stick and I was unable to restore InstallESD.dmg to a 4 GB USB stick but of course the reason that wouldn\\'t fit is there was slightly more than 4 GB of data.', 'timestamp': '2019-04-21T10:07:13Z', 'url': 'https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/restore-from-larger-disk-to-smaller-disk.1311329/'}\n",
